### E-commerce 

1- npm install **lucide-react** -> this is a dependency for use some template files, like Check icons.
<br />
2- npx **shadcn-ui@latest** add button -> this is ui to add template for the button.
<br />
3- **shadcn-ui**, we also add **theme** for full page, that reallu help to organize the pages more easily. for example: change the color of the button.
<br />
4. in this case, we use **Kinde** for the Auth. But i also remember that we can do it by **WorkOS**.
    - Kinde  BAD: have really bad taste and can not set password for website Good: easy use
